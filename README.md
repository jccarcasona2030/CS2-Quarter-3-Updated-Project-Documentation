Updated Project Documentation

(Write your project name here)

# Project Description

Brief explanation of what your system/app does.

Example:

This project is a web-based system that allows users to manage tasks efficiently through a simple and responsive interface.


# Updated Feature List
	•	Feature 1 (explain briefly)
	•	Feature 2
	•	Removed Feature (if any)
	•	Improved Feature (if any)


# Revised File Structure

Explain how your files are organized.
Example:

/frontend
   index.html
   style.css
   script.js

/backend
   server.js
   database.js
Briefly explain what each major file does.



#Technologies Used (with Justification)
	•	HTML – for structure
	•	CSS – for styling
	•	JavaScript – for functionality
	•	Node.js – for backend processing
	•	MongoDB – for database storage

Explain WHY you used each.

Example:

Node.js was used to handle backend requests efficiently.



# Methodology

#How Core Features Were Implemented

Explain how major features work.

Example:

The login system validates user input and checks stored credentials before granting access.


# Backend–Frontend Communication (if applicable)

Explain how they connect.

Example:

The frontend sends HTTP requests using Fetch API, and the backend responds in JSON format.

If you don’t have backend, write:

This project is frontend-only and does not use backend communication.



#Key Design Decisions / Trade-offs

Example:
	•	Chose simple UI over complex animations for better performance.
	•	Used local storage instead of database due to time constraints.



#Programming and Computing Ethics

In this project, we ensured:
	•	Proper crediting of open-source resources
	•	Respect for intellectual property
	•	Consideration for accessibility (readable fonts, clear contrast)
	•	Protection of user privacy (no unnecessary data collection)

This follows the guidelines of the
Association for Computing Machinery and its
ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
