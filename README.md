School Lunch Price Calculator

# Project Description

The School Lunch Price Calculator is a simple Python-based console application that allows users to input lunch item prices, view the added items, and calculate the total cost.

This program helps students practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, lists, and user input handling.


# Updated Feature List
	•	Add multiple lunch item prices
	•	View all added prices
	•	Automatically calculate total cost
	•	Handles invalid menu choices
	•	Uses a looped menu system for continuous use

# Revised File Structure

    school-lunch-calculator/
    │
    ├── main.py
    └── README.md

# File Description:
	•	main.py – Contains the main program logic, menu system, and price calculations.
	•	README.md – Project documentation and explanation.

# Technologies Used
	•	Python – Used to build the console-based calculator because it is beginner-friendly and ideal for practicing basic programming logic.

    Python was chosen for its simplicity and readability, making the program easy to understand and maintain.


## Methodology

# How Core Features Were Implemented
	•	A list was used to store item prices.
	•	A while loop keeps the program running until the user exits.
	•	Conditional statements (if-elif-else) control menu choices.
	•	The built-in sum() function calculates the total cost.

# Key Design Decisions
	•	The program uses a simple text-based interface to keep it beginner-friendly.
	•	Data is stored temporarily in a list instead of a database for simplicity.
	•	The menu system allows repeated actions without restarting the program.

# Programming and Computing Ethics

    In developing this project, we ensured:
	    •	Original code was written by the group.
	    •	No copyrighted code was copied without permission.
	    •	Proper credit is given if external references were used.
	    •	The program does not collect or store personal user data.

    This aligns with principles from the
    Association for Computing Machinery and the
    ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, which promote responsible and ethical computing practices.
